================================================================
UPGRADING FROM VERSION 6.x-1.1 to 6.x-2
================================================================
THE XMPPFRAMEWORK MODULE PROVIDES AN UPGRADE PATH TO TRY AND KEEP ANY 
CHANGES TO A MINIMAL AND TO TRY AND ENSURE NO DATA FOR YOUR USERS IS 
LOST. BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS UPGRADE PLEASE BACKUP YOUR DATABASE SO YOU 
CAN REVERT BACK IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

1) Before installing 6.x-2 please go to your site and disable the following
modules. xmppclient, xmpp_messaging and xmpp_notifications. Admin / Site 
Building / Modules un-check these but "DO NOT" un-install them at this time.

2) Completely remove the xmppframework directory from your file system and 
download the xmppframework 6.x-2 version from http://drupal.org/project/xmppframework.

3) Untar the xmppframework module and place under your modules directory.

4) Enable the xmpp_user and xmpp_client modules in the system. 

The modules should now be ready to use if the copy of the data from the old 
xmppclient module has been successful. If you wish you can manually remove 
the xmppclient_user and xmppclient_user_properties tables.
