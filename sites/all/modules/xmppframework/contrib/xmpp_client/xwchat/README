XMPP THIN CLIENT
================
The XMPP Thin Client strives to be a fully functional web client that does not
require any downloading of third party software onto your machine in order to utilize.

The client was built out of a need too produce a web thin client for one of our projects.

GOALS
=====
The goals of this client were to make it stand alone but also support the ability
to tie the client into a web server if required. The client should utilize a lot of
AJAX in order to retrieve information and tries to keep a lot of information in the
browser memory thus it does not have to go back to the server unless it if for more
information refreshment.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================
xmppclient --|
             -- img -> directory holds all images that the client utilizes
             |
             -- src -> directory holds the source files for th JSJaC library the client utilizes
             |
             -- jqueryplugins -> directory holds the sources for all jquery plugins utilized
             |
             -- xct -> directory holds all of the translation files for each language supported

THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES UTILIZED
==============================
XMPP Thin Client utilizes the JSJaC library written by Stefan Strigler <steve@zeank.in-berlin.de>
Would like to thank Stefan for such a great library as a base to develop a viable application from.

XMPP Thin Client utilizes the JQuery <http://jquery.com/> library to make all of the javascript handling
easier.
