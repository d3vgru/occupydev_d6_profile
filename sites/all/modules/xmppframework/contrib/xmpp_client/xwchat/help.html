	<h4>Words to know</h4>
	<div style="">

	<p>To make this document easier to use, we'd like to first introduce a few words, used frequently, that are important when discussing chat applications.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Chat (noun):</strong> a real-time, online conversation between two or more people. EX: "The chat yesterday was very productive."
		<li><strong>Chat (verb):</strong> participating in a real-time, online conversation between two or more people. EX: "Let's chat about this instead of having a long email chain."
		<li><strong>Multi-User Chat (noun):</strong> a Chat that involves more than two people. Abb. MUC, Synonyms: Group Chat. EX: "We have a MUC scheduled for tomorrow at 13:00 EST, don't be late."
		<li><strong>Chat server:</strong> this will refer to the software and Web address through which a chat client sends and receives messages. EX: "Tomorrow's MUC will be on our internal chat server, xmpp://conference.ourserver.example"
		<li><strong>Chad ID:</strong> the unique address that identifies a person registered on a chat server, in the format "name"@"chat_server". You will use this to send messages to another person. Synonyms: JID. EX: "Add me to your contact list; my chat ID is matt@ourserver.example."
		<li><strong>Contact:</strong> a person with a Chat ID, registered on a chat server, that can participate in chats. Synonyms: User. EX: "How many users are in your contact list?"
		<li><strong>Contact List:</strong> a list that is maintained by your chat server and stores the Chat IDs of your contacts. EX: "I have 34 contacts saved in my contact list."
		<li><strong>Contact Group:</strong> an object used to organize the contacts in your contact list. EX: "I have my contacts split into three groups: Family, Co-workers, and Clients."
		<li><strong>XMPP:</strong> is an acronym for Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. It is a system that allows people to send each other chat messages on the Internet. Anyone who has an XMPP chat ID and is using a chat client (like XWChat) can communicate with other people who meet the same criteria.</ul>
	</div>

	<h4>The Contact List</h4>
	<div style="min-height:450px;">
	<img src="help/img/contact.png" />
	<p>The contact list shows you the chat users you have established connections with. The list will tell you if they are available, away, or offline, and allows you to group your contacts to make finding them in your list easier. The contact list has a right-click menu for each contact, allowing you to perform actions including update their status, viewing their chat profile (vCard) information, or removing/updating them from/on your list. </p>
	</div>

	<h4>The chat window</h4>
	<div style="min-height:320px;">
	<img src="help/img/indv-chat.png">
<p>Communication happens through the chat window. When you either left-click on a person in your contact list, right-click on the person and then choose "chat", or receive a message from another user, XWChat will open a chat window. From inside the chat window, you can:</p>
<ul><li>Send and receive chat messages
<li>Start a group chat with the person to whom you're chatting
<li>Save a copy of the chat conversation, and
<li>Interact with them through their user-context menu.</ul>

<p>The group chat window allows you to talk with many people at once. The group chat window offers the same features as the one-on-one chat window, along with the ability to:</p>
<ul><li>Invite additional participants
<li>Set and change the group chat's status message, and
<li>Change your display name.</ul>
	</div>

<h4>Settings</h4>
	<div style="min-height:250px;">
	<img src="help/img/settings.png">
<p>XWChat offers a customizable chat experience free from the clutter presented in many popular clients. "Settings" allows a user to customize some of the ways they interact with XWChat. These settings include:</p>
<ul><li>Chat Configuration
	<ul><li>Automatically Archive Chats on the server: Will publish a copy of each chat you participate in to your account on the site.
	<li>Show Empty Groups: Tells the contact list to show contact groups, even if you have no users in them.
	<li>Show Offline Associates: By default, XWChat hides users in your contact list who are offline and inaccessible. You may change this default so that every person in your contact list is displayed, whether or not they are online.
	<li>Show Send Buttons on Message and Group Chat: Striking the "Enter" key on your keyboard duplicates the function of the Send Button. Some users prefer to hide the send button so that they have a wider typing area in their Chat windows.
	<li>Show Time stamps in Chat Windows: Selecting this option will show (next to the User name) the date/time each message in a conversation was sent or received.
	<li>Client font size: This option increases or decreases the size of the text for all of the windows in XWChat. </ul>
<li>Language Settings for Client: The language selected in this option tells XWChat what language you are chatting in, as well as the language in which you want XWChat to display the application's text.
<li>Real-time Translation Configuration
	<ul><li>Real-time Chat Translation: Use this option to tell XWChat if it should translate incoming text into another language.
	<li>Current chat language: This is the language into which XWChat will translate incoming messages.</ul></ul>

<div id="tab5">
<h3 class="ui-accordion-header">3 - Multi-User Chat (MUC)</h3>
<h4>Join a MUC</h4>
<div style="min-height:200px;">
<img src="help/img/find-group.png">
<ul><li>Click the [Group Chat] button on the bottom right of the window.
<li>The chat server for your site will be preloaded in the "Server" field. Click "Get Rooms" to see the MUC rooms available to join.
<ul><li>NOTE: If you wish to join a room in another chat server, you will need to replace the pre-loaded info with the address of the server you wish to join. You need to know this information to find rooms in a different server.</ul>
<li>Left-click on a room in the generated list, then scroll to the bottom and click "Enter" to join the MUC.
<li>Optional: If you question that a room is the MUC you are looking for, clicking "Info" after selecting a room will display some information about the room.

</div>

<h4>Start a MUC</h4>

<p>MUCs can be started two ways. If you start from the contact list:</p>
<ul><li>Click the [Group Chat] button on the bottom right of the window.
<li>Select the [Create] tab at the top of the group session window.
<li>Enter a nickname, then at least a Room title for the chat room you wish to create and click the "create" button.
<ul><li>NOTE: By default, the chat server will delete a MUC room if no participants are using it. To keep a room, even if it has zero participants, select "yes" next to the option "Make room persistent:".</ul>
<li>When creating a Group Chat room, many options are presented. Feel free to set any options available to you. Once a group is created, you may not edit these settings, so if you wish to change settings in the future, you will need to remove the group from the chat server and re-create it with your new settings.</ul>
If you start from a one-on-one chat window:
<ul><li>Click the [Group Chat] button on the bottom right of the chat window
<li>A group chat session will be created, with you and the person you were chatting as group chat session members.</ul>
</div>

<h4>Inviting more participants</h4>
<div style="min-height:260px;">
<img src="help/img/group-invite.png">
<p><em>NOTE: You can find the Chat ID for users in your contact list by right-clicking on their name and choosing "Info." The Chat ID will be next to "User Details" at the top of the new window.</em></p>
