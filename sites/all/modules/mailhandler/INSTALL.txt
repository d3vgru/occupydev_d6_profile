REQUIREMENTS
------------

You will need to have access to a dedicated mailbox (IMAP or POP3) to receive
posts via email. You must also have the PHP IMAP library installed- see the
documentation referenced at the bottom of this file for more information.

Dependencies:
- ctools (6.x-1.x-dev is recommended until 1.9 is released)
- feeds >= 6.x-1.0-beta11
- autoload >= 6.x-2.0

QUICK SETUP
-----------

Mailhandler 2.x requires configuration of two primary components: a mailbox, 
which stores access information for an IMAP/POP mailbox such as the username
and password, and a feeds importer, which checks and retrieves messages from a 
mailbox.

The easiest way to get started is to follow these steps:
- Enable required modules:
  - Go to $base_url/admin/build/modules
  - Enable the "Mailhandler Default" module.
  - Enable the "Mailhandler PHP IMAP" module.
- Create a mailbox:
  - Go to $base_url/admin/build/mailhandler/add
  - Fill in the details for your IMAP/POP3 mailbox and click "Test and save".
  - Mailhandler will report how many messages are in the mailbox if it is able
    to connect.
- Test the default importer:
  - Send a test email to your mailbox.
  - Go to $base_url/import/mailhandler_nodes
  - Select the mailbox you just set up from the drop-down menu.
  - Select "Import".
  - Your email should be imported as a node!

Want to import new emails automatically on cron runs?
- Create an importer content type:
  - Go to $base_url/admin/content/types/add
  - Name your content type "Mailhandler importer" / mailhandler_importer.
- Attach the default importer to this content type:
  - Go to $base_url/admin/build/feeds/edit/mailhandler_nodes/settings
  - For "Attach to content type", select "Mailhandler importer".
  - Select "Save".
- Create a Mailhandler importer feed node:
  - Go to $base_url/node/add/mailhandler_importer
  - For "Feed"->"Mailbox", select the mailbox you set up above.
  - Select "Save".
  - New emails will be imported on cron runs!

OVERVIEW
--------

Mailhandler fetches content from IMAP or POP mailboxes, which are represented by
the mailhandler_mailbox_ui class. Feeds Importers configured to use the
Mailhandler Fetcher can use these mailboxes as Feeds Sources, in the same way
that Importers using the HTTP Fetcher would use URLs as sources.

Thus, at the bare minimum you must configure at least one mailbox and at least
one Feeds Importer, as described in the section above.

A Feeds Importer is made up of a Fetcher, Parser, and Processor. Mailhandler
provides only a Fetcher and Parser, and requires the use of an existing
processor (typically, the Node Processor or Comment Processor). Additionally,
Mailhandler defines two types of plugins that extend the Mailhandler Parser:
'authentication plugins' match the sender of the email to a Drupal user account,
while 'commmand plugins' extract various parts of a message (such as files and
IMAP headers) and allow users to 'command' attributes of created content using
key: value pairs.

You can either manually run an importer, or you can attach an importer to a
content type. Then you'll need to create a new node of the corresponding type,
choosing from the node form which mailbox to tie to that node, save the node,
and then you'll be able to import from the node view of that node, or import on
cron.

Finally, Mailhandler provides some input filters that can strip common garbage
from imported messages (such as signatures).
  
FETCHER CONFIGURATION
---------------------

Using the 'filter' setting, choose which types of messages to retrieve (nodes,
comments, or all). Note: if this importer fetches a type of message that the
processor (below) does not support, that message will be marked as read or
deleted! Thus, it's important to set this filter appropriately.

PARSER CONFIGURATION
--------------------

Choose plugins to handle commands and authentication, as well as set available
and default commands. The commands plugins generate mapping sources that will
appear in the processor mapping form in the next step.

For instance, setting the available commands to "status" and default commands to
"status: 1" will publish all posts (if the processor, below, is configured
appropriately), and allow users to override this by placing the command
"status: 0" at the top of the body of emails.

PROCESSOR CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

You will most likely want to use the Node Processor or Comment Processor.

For Nodes Processor settings, choose (among other things) whether authorization
should be performed- in other words, whether the post author has permissions to
actually post content (by default Feeds doesn't check this).

For Nodes Processor mappings, you'll need to map "sources", provided by the
Mailhandler Parser and its command plugins, to node "targets". Note that if you
don't map things correctly here, certain features that you configured earlier
(such as authorization and commands processing) will not work.

To prevent re-importation of duplicate messages, you will want to map the
"Message ID" source to a field and mark it as unique. For more information, see
http://drupal.org/node/1329218

If you would like to import comments by email, you can download Mailcomment and
Feeds Comment Processor and select the Feeds Comment Processor instead.
