/**
 * Authenticate message based on token from tokenauth module.
 *
 * If the user's token is found somewhere in the "to" field, assign that user's
 * uid and name to the node object. A rough search for the token somewhere in
 * the "toaddress" is performed instead of an exact, ordered match in order to
 * allow some freedom in the format of allowed "toaddress". For example, if
 * using a catchall email address, the toaddress could be:
 *
 * f93ksj35dx@example.com - where f93ksj35dx is the user's token or
 * alternatively:
 * f93ksj35dx-foo@example.com - where f93ksj35dx is the user's token and foo is
 * the name of an Organic Group to which the message should be assigned.
 *
 * A rough search allows for different approaches to use this single
 * authentication method.
