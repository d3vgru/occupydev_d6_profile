DESCRIPTION
===========
OAuth is a complete standard for external API authentication. You might integrate
your Drupal site with external data from Google, Flickr, Twitter, Ma.gnolia, Yahoo
and other Drupal sites that uses Web Services module. Also you can also let other
sites use your site's data, by using Web Services module and OAuth as the
authentication method for security.

Imagine that OpenID is like your car key: you have to be at the website to log in.
OAuth is like a valet key: you can hand to a website to operate on your behalf,
even when you're not there.

Never give your username and password to other sites again!
